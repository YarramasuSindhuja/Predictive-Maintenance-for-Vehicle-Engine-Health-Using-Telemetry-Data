# Predictive Maintenance for Vehicle Engine Health Using Telemetry Data

This project focuses on leveraging telemetry data to predict potential failures and health issues in vehicle engines. Using machine learning models, it analyzes real-time data to provide actionable insights into engine performance and maintenance needs.

## Project Overview

Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach to managing vehicle engine health by analyzing data collected from sensors and telemetry systems. This project uses historical engine data, including temperature, RPM, pressure, and other parameters, to predict when maintenance should be performed. The goal is to prevent engine failures, minimize downtime, and save costs by performing maintenance only when needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning model implementation.
- **Machine Learning**: Supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) for predicting engine failures.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: If you're using deep learning models (optional).

## Dataset

This project uses telemetry data from vehicles, including but not limited to the following features:
- Engine temperature
- RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)
- Fuel consumption
- Engine pressure
- Vehicle speed
- Oil levels

**Note:** The dataset used is available from [Data Source Link] (if you're using a public dataset or your custom dataset).

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of telemetry data from vehicle sensors.
- **Failure Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of engine failures or component degradation.
- **Maintenance Recommendations**: Suggest optimal times for maintenance based on predicted engine health.
